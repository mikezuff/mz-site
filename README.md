This is the code for my website [zuff.dev](https://zuff.dev).

It uses Hugo with the hugo-scroll theme.

I don't use a bunch of its features but if I ever wanted to I would look at the various files in themes/hugo-scroll/exampleSite/content/ or try tweaking it with

```
cd hugo-scroll
hugo server --source=exampleSite --themesDir=../..
```
